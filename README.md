# Food Delivery Service Data Science Project



Data Analysis & Insights of Food Delivery Service.

This project analyzes the non-historical food delivery data from students at IIITDM Kancheepuram. The primary goal is to identify trends and patterns in student ordering behavior, delivery times, and popular food preferences. The insights gained are intended to help optimize menu pricing and improve profitability for the food service.
## Key Features

- **Data Collection:** Non-historical data was collected via surveys (Google Forms) including fields like student roll numbers, email, order price, restaurant name, food type, meal, and day.
- **Data Cleaning:** Techniques used include handling null values, removing duplicates, and cleaning data to ensure accurate analysis.
 - **Exploratory Data Analytics (EDA):** We performed visualizations using bar graphs, line charts, and pie charts to explore the dataset.
- **Model Evaluation & Prediction:** Predictive models were employed to analyze food expenditure patterns.
## Project Workflow:
